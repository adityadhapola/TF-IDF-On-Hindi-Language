# TF-IDF-On-Hindi-Language:

TF-IDF :
tf-idf stands for Term frequency-inverse document frequency. The tf-idf weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining. Variations of the tf-idf weighting scheme are often used by search engines in scoring and ranking a document's relevance given a query. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus. 
Mostly the TF-IDF is done on English language; which made me curious about its behaviour on other languages. So, I tried doing it on my native language i.e Hindi and the results were pretty interesting.

tf-idf is basically a weighting scheme that assigns each term in a document a weight based on its term frequency (tf) and inverse document frequency (idf). The terms with higher weight scores are considered to be more important.
Typically, the tf-idf weight is composed by two terms-
1.Normalized Term Frequency (tf)
2.Inverse Document Frequency (idf)
